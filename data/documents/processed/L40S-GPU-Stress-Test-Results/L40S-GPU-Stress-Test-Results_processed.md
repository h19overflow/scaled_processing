**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's a detailed analysis of the provided document image and text:

**Image Analysis**

*   The image shows a graph with an upward trending line, suggesting growth or increase. It's encased in a pink square with rounded corners, likely indicating a button or icon. The graph depicts an increase, followed by a slight plateau, then another steeper increase.
*   Visually, it signifies a positive trend or growth.

**Text Analysis**

*   **Overall Context:** This document presents the results of a stress test performed on an L40S GPU. It is likely a report intended to guide hardware deployment decisions for multi-user AI services.
*   **Executive Summary:** The L40S GPU is deemed unsuitable for production deployment due to performance limitations.
*   **Key Finding:** It fails significantly under multi-user load.
*   **Bottom Line:**  A clear statement of the GPU's inadequacy for the intended purpose.
*   **Critical Metrics:**
    *   **80% failure rate:** A very high failure rate with only 32 concurrent users. This is a critical issue.
    *   **Response Time Degradation:** Response times increased from 3.5 seconds to over 33 seconds. This indicates extreme performance slowdown under load, making the system unusable.
    *   **VRAM Saturation:** VRAM saturation of 91.3% before any user request is a severe limitation. It indicates insufficient memory capacity.

**Relationship between Image and Text**

*   The graph icon likely symbolizes overall performance or some key metric related to the GPU's performance. Given the negative findings in the text, the image's upward trend is ironic, suggesting the opposite of the actual results: poor scalability and high failure rates. It might be used to contrast expectations vs. reality or it is a generic icon used throughout.
*   The graph is most likely a placeholder, and the actual data likely exists within the document (mentioned in the text: "[Document contains tables/charts]").

**Technical Details**

*   **L40S GPU:** The specific hardware being tested.
*   **Multi-user AI services:** The intended application, implying high performance and scalability needs.
*   **Concurrent users:** A key metric for scalability, with 32 users proving too much for the GPU.
*   **Response Time:** A crucial measure of user experience, which is drastically degraded.
*   **VRAM (Video RAM) Saturation:** This indicates that the GPU's memory is insufficient to handle the workload, leading to performance bottlenecks.
*   **Stress Test:** Simulating high usage to evaluate stability and performance under realistic conditions.

**In Summary**

The document reveals a critical failure of the L40S GPU to meet the performance requirements of a multi-user AI service. The image is a potentially misleading visual element.

## Executive Summary

## Current Hardware Cannot Support Production Deployment

## Key Finding

## Bottom Line

L40S GPU is fundamentally inadequate for multi-user AI services due to critical performance limitations.

## Critical Metrics

- 80% failure rate at 32 concurrent users.
- Response time degradation from 3.5 seconds to 33+ seconds.
- 91.3% VRAM saturation before any user requests.

The L40S represents a technical deadend for production deployment of concurrent AI services. Immediate hardware upgrade is required.

## Research Methodology

## Formal Hypothesis Testing Approach

## Null Hypothesis (H )

## Alternative Hypothesis (H¡)

Increasing concurrent inference requests on L40S GPU has no significant negative effect on system failure rate, response latency, or semantic quality of Llama 3.1 8B model outputs.

Increasing concurrent requests will cause significant increases in failure rates and response latency, plus measurable degradation in response quality, coherence, and accuracy, resulting in hallucinations and unusable output.

Test Design: Systematic stress testing was conducted from 1 to 32 concurrent users, meticulously collecting comprehensive performance and quality metrics to validate our hypotheses. This approach allowed us to identify critical bottlenecks and assess system behavior under realistic load conditions.

Under load, the L40S GPU exhibits catastrophic reliability failures , rendering the service functionally useless for multi-user scenarios. This is not a partial degradation but a complete breakdown.

- 3 concurrent users: 75% failure rate
- 32 concurrent users: 80% failure rate
- 4 out of 5 user queries receive no response at peak load.

## Business Impact

- Cannot deploy a service that fails for the majority of users. This level of unreliability would immediately destroy user trust and render the application functionally useless.
- At high concurrency the llm was able to respond , but in flawed way , exposing internal prompt, changing language , repeating prompt or question.

## Response Times Become Unacceptable Under Load

![Image 14](C:\Users\User\Projects\scaled_processing\data\documents\raw\extracted_images\L40S-GPU-Stress-Test-Results\picture-14.png)

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's an analysis of the provided document image and surrounding text:

- Single user: 3.5 seconds average response time
- 32 users: 33+ seconds average response time
- 10x performance degradation at scale, far beyond acceptable limits for interactive AI.

The performance degradation is exponential , not linear. Some users experience reasonable wait times, while others face delays of nearly a minute, leading to an inconsistent and frustrating experience.

## Business Impact

- Slow and unpredictable service leads to user frustration and abandonment. An AI assistant slower than manual work defeats the purpose of automation and provides no tangible value.
- When load is too much the model does not answer , in the case of 32 concurrent requests the model gave incoherent answers.

## Finding 3 - Quality Deterioration

## Response Incoherence

![Image 30](C:\Users\User\Projects\scaled_processing\data\documents\raw\extracted_images\L40S-GPU-Stress-Test-Results\picture-30.png)

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's a breakdown of the image and its potential relationship to the surrounding document:

**Image Analysis**

*   The image displays the text "$300K". The "K" most likely stands for thousand, so the amount in the image is $300,000.

**Relationship to Document**

Based on the document text, here's how the image might relate:

*   **Cost/Investment:** $300K could represent the cost of the L40S GPU hardware, the budget allocated for testing, or a potential financial loss due to the GPU's failure to meet performance requirements.
*   **Potential Savings/Revenue:** If the document discusses an alternative solution or hardware recommendation, $300K could represent the potential cost savings.

**Additional Considerations**

Without more context, it's hard to know the precise meaning, but the document indicates that the L40S GPU failed in a multi-user AI service environment.



A systematic breakdown in response coherence is observed, resulting in nonsensical or contradictory outputs.

Observable Failure Modes: The model "forgets" conversation context mid-response, generates contradictory or nonsensical outputs, and produces factually incorrect information (hallucinations). This is not just a performance issue; it's a fundamental quality collapse .

## Business Impact

- Unreliable AI output is worse than no AI 3 it actively misleads users and requires human verification, eliminating any potential efficiency gains and introducing new risks.

## AI Responds in Wrong Language Under Load

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

## 16 Concurrent requests History:

This occurs when the AI responds in a language different from the question's language.

## Business Impact

- Highly unprofessional for a corporate tool. Makes the system appear broken and untrustworthy, eroding user confidence immediately and reflecting poorly on the brand.

## AI Provides Wrong Answer While Explaining Correct One

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

## 16 Concurrent requests History:

## question\_id: 5 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was A , but the ai\_reasoning argues for the correct answer, C : "The correct answer is 6. C because the article states that..."

## question\_id: 8 (eval\_type: Answer)

- Evidence: The ai\_answer is C , but the ai\_reasoning explains why B is correct: "This shows that he has to work every day... Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

## question\_id: 8 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was C , but the ai\_reasoning is a detailed explanation for why B is correct: "Let9s break down the question and the passage to understand why option B is the correct answer."

## question\_id: 15 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was B , but the ai\_reasoning argues for the correct answer, F : "The correct answer is 33. F because it accurately reflects the idea that..."

## question\_id: 16 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was A , but the ai\_reasoning explains why D is correct: "The correct answer is 34. D because it highlights the potential economic impact..."

## question\_id: 0

- Evidence: The AI claims the answer is B (Warfare) but then states in its reasoning that the text provides no evidence for how the territories were conquered: "...tanpa menyebutkan cara bagaimana wilayah ini ditakluki."

## question\_id: 2 (eval\_type: Answer)

- Evidence: The ai\_answer is D. The reasoning begins by arguing for C ("...karya tersebut lebih fokus pada mengungkap penderitaan hidup bangsa.") before illogically concluding that D is the correct answer.

## question\_id: 2 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was D, but the entire teaching explanation argues for the correct answer, C: "Saya senang membantu kamu memahami jawaban yang benar, C."

## question\_id: 6 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was D, but the teaching explanation argues for A: "The correct answer is A because..."

## question\_id: 7 (eval\_type: Teaching)

- Evidence: The AI's chosen answer was C, but the teaching explanation argues for D: "Saya akan menjelaskan mengapa jawaban yang benar adalah D."

## Business Impact

- Actively misleading users. Worse than being simply wrong, this behavior is confusing and propagates incorrect information, completely undermining the AI's purpose as a reliable knowledge source.

## Complete System Breakdown in Response Generation

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

## question\_id: 3

- Evidence: The ai\_answer is "English," which is not a valid choice. The ai\_reasoning is an incomplete fragment that begins with a system-like message: "The final response which ends this conversation will be used by students..."

## 16 Concurrent requests History:

## question\_id: 6 (eval\_type: Answer)

- Evidence: The question requires filling ten blanks, but the ai\_answer is just "Answer: B". The ai\_reasoning is a generic system message: "The final response which ends this conversation"

## question\_id: 7

- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning provides no explanation and is composed entirely of system-like text: "Answer: The question is in English, so the response will be in English. Here is the detailed response to the question: Answer: The final response which ends this conversation"
- question\_id: 14
- Evidence: Both the ai\_answer and ai\_reasoning are a nonsensical system message: "The final response which ends this conversation"
- question\_id: 16 (eval\_type: Answer)
- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning is not an explanation but a full copy of the original context provided in the prompt.

Technical Cause: Severe memory pressure on the L40S GPU forces the model to output fragments of internal programming or default messages, indicating that it cannot process or generate coherent responses.

<!-- image -->

## Business Impact

- Total system failure. The model is not even attempting to answer questions, indicating a complete and catastrophic breakdown in the generation process. This renders the AI completely ineffective.

## AI Exposes Internal Instructions to Users

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

This occurs when the AI "leaks" parts of its underlying instructions or system context into the user-facing response.

## question\_id: 13 (eval\_type: Answer)

- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning includes text that is clearly part of its instructions: "The writer mentions that he was deployed in an educational assessment system. Students rely on your accuracy and reasoning quality... LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: If the question and context are in Malay language, respond entirely in Malay..."

Technical Cause: Memory overflow causes the model to confuse internal instructions with response content, leading to a critical security and integrity breach.

## Business Impact

- Critical trust breach. Exposes system inner workings and produces nonsensical, untrustworthy text that fundamentally compromises user confidence and brand reputation.
- This is an unacceptable failure mode for any production system.
- This could lead to leaking sensitive information , or perhaps exposing company secrets in production.

## Root Cause Analysis

## VRAM Saturation

A critical analysis reveals that the L40S GPU experiences severe memory saturation, even before processing any user requests. This underlying issue directly contributes to the previously observed system instabilities and quality failures.

## Critical Memory Statistics

## Technical Implication

## Direct Consequence

- L40S total VRAM: 46,068 MiB
- Llama 3.1 8B model consumption: 42,055 MiB
- Memory utilization: 91.3% before any user connects
- Available working memory: Less than 9% (~3 GB)

## Summary of Findings

## Issue

The GPU9s memory is almost fully consumed by the AI model before any user interaction. The model alone occupies over 90% of available memory, leaving less than 10% free.

## Impact

Because conversations require additional memory to maintain context, the system is forced to aggressively clear and swap memory. This leads to frequent loss of conversation history.

## Consequence

The AI is unable to reliably maintain context, which directly results in contradictory, inconsistent, or nonsensical responses.

## Conclusion

The model is oversized for the available hardware, making stable and reliable operation impractical under current conditions.

Each concurrent user requires KV Cache memory for conversation context. With virtually no free VRAM, the system is forced into aggressive cache swapping and deletion.

When the model loses its KV Cache, it loses conversation context. This is the direct technical cause of all observed hallucinations, contradictory logic, and nonsensical outputs.

## Real-World vs Test Environment

## Actual Production Load Would Be Worse

The stress test results, while alarming, were conducted under controlled conditions that do not fully replicate the complexities of a real-world production environment. Understanding these differences is crucial for assessing the true potential for system failure.

## Test Environment Characteristics:

## Real-World Environment:

- Structured, sequential testing (e.g., 1 user ³ stop ³ 5 users ³ stop)
- Predictable "burst-and-rest" patterns, allowing for memory recovery
- Continuous, unpredictable request streams
- Multiple users with overlapping sessions
- No graceful rest periods for memory recovery or cache clearing
- Controlled timing between requests

Implication: The 80% failure rate observed in our controlled stress tests represents a best-case scenario . A live production environment would likely experience significantly higher failure rates and more severe quality degradation due to constant memory pressure and lack of recovery periods.

## Underestimated Risk

The controlled test environment provided a generous operational window for the GPU to recover. In a genuine production scenario, the L40S GPU would face relentless, concurrent demands , exacerbating memory saturation and leading to even more frequent and severe quality failures for end-users.

## GPU Performance Analysis

## Hardware Performing Optimally Within Design Limits

A detailed analysis of the L40S GPU during stress testing confirms that the hardware itself is operating within its design limits and performing optimally, ruling out common causes of failure such as overheating or insufficient processing power.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## GPU Health Indicators

- Performance State: Consistent P0 (maximum level)
- Temperature: Never exceeded 68°C (well within limits)
- Power Draw: ~280W (below 350W limit)
- No Thermal Throttling or Hardware Malfunctions

## Critical Insight

System failures are NOT caused by:

- GPU overheating
- Insufficient processing power
- Hardware defects
- Software inefficiencies

## Conclusion

The GPU is running at its full potential, yet this potential is fundamentally insufficient for our requirements. The hardware is performing as designed, but its design limits are being exceeded by the demands of the AI model.

## Technical Solution Requirements

## Current Constraint

## Hardware Needs for Production Deployment

The fundamental limitation identified is that the L40S GPU's VRAM capacity is insufficient to load the AI model and simultaneously support the necessary KV (Key-Value) cache for multiple concurrent user sessions, leading to memory saturation and system instability.

## Sufficient VRAM Capacity

The new hardware must provide ample VRAM to comfortably accommodate the Llama 3.1 8B model and maintain KV caches for a robust number of concurrent user sessions without aggressive swapping or memory loss.

## Enterprise-Grade Reliability &amp; Performance

## Scalability for Concurrent Users

This includes head-room for future model updates or additional features.

The solution requires hardware designed for continuous, high-load operation, ensuring stability, consistent performance, and minimal downtime to meet enterprise service level agreements (SLAs).

This includes robust error handling and fault tolerance.

The chosen hardware must be inherently scalable, capable of efficiently supporting hundreds of concurrent users, dynamically adjusting to demand spikes, and ensuring a seamless, responsive experience for every user.

This implies not just more VRAM, but also optimized memory management.

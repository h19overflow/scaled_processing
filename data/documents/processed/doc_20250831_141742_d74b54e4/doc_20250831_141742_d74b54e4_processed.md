## Writing effective prompts

From the very beginning, Google Workspace was built to allow you to collaborate in real time with other people. Now, you can also collaborate with AI using Gemini for Google Workspace to help boost your productivity and creativity without sacrificing privacy or security. The embedded generative AI-powered features can help you write, organize information, create images, accelerate workflows, have richer meetings, and much more, all while using your favorite apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprisegrade security). Gemini is accessible right where you are doing your work - with access to your personal knowledge base in Drive, Docs, Gmail, and more - so you can enhance and create powerful workflows across the Workspace apps with less tab switching and interruption.

This guide provides you with the foundational skills to write effective prompts when using Gemini for Workspace. You can think of a prompt as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several prompts as the conversation progresses. While the possibilities are virtually endless, you can put consistent best practices to work today.

The four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt are:

- Persona
- Task
- Context
- Format

Here is an example of a prompt using all four areas that could work well in Gmail and Google Docs:

You are a program manager in [industry].  Draft an executive summary email to  [persona] based on [details about relevant program docs].  Limit to bullet points.

You don't need to use all four in every prompt, but using a few will help! Always remember to include a verb or command as part of your task; this is the most important component of a prompt.

**Readable Text Content:**

## Here are quick tips to get you started with Gemini for Google Workspace:

1.  Use natural language. Write as if you're speaking to another person. Express complete thoughts in full sentences.
2.  Be specific and iterate. Tell Gemini what you need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone, create). Provide as much context as possible.
3.  Be concise and avoid complexity. State your request in brief - but specific - language. Avoid jargon.
4.  Make it a conversation. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don't meet your expectations or if you believe there's room for improvement. Use follow-up prompts and an iterative process of review and refinement to yield better results.
5.  Use your documents. Personalize Gemini's output with information from your own files in Google Drive.
6.  Make Gemini your prompt editor. When using Gemini Advanced, start your prompts with: 'Make this a power prompt: [original prompt text here].' Gemini will make suggestions on how to improve your prompt. Ensure it says what you need, and then paste it back into Gemini Advanced to get an output.

Prompting is a skill we can all learn. You don't have to be a prompt engineer to use generative AI. However, you will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you don't get your desired outcome the first time. Based on what we've learned from our users so far, the most fruitful prompts average around 21 words with relevant context, yet the prompts people try are usually less than nine words.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it's still new. Even though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes have unpredictable responses.

Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review it to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans but the final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.

## Introduction

## Gemini for Google Workspace: Prompting 101

Gemini for Workspace is your AI-powered assistant integrated into the apps you use every day - Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-grade security). This means the apps you know and use will work together smoothly so you can collaborate with Gemini right where you are. You can have fewer interruptions to your focus and workflow, helping you complete tasks and do things you might not have initially known how to do.

You can access the features of Gemini for Workspace in multiple ways. Engaging with Gemini in the side panel of your Workspace apps allows you to create highly personalized generative AI outputs that are based on your own files and documents - even if they aren't Google Docs. You can generate personalized emails in seconds referencing your own Docs to pull in relevant context, generate Slides that are based on information directly from your own briefs or reports, and so much more.

Understanding what makes an effective prompt and learning to craft prompts on the fly can boost your productivity and creativity. Gemini for Workspace can help you:

-  Improve your writing
-  Organize data
-  Create original images
-  Summarize information and surface insights
-  Have better meetings with automatic note taking
-  Research unfamiliar topics easily
-  Spot trends, synthesize information, and identify business opportunities

For 25 years, Google has built helpful, secure products that give users choice and control over their data. It's a bedrock principle for us. This was the case back when we first launched Gmail in 2004, and it remains true in the era of generative AI. This means your data is your data and does not belong to Google. Your data stays in your Workspace environment. Your privacy is protected. Your content is never used for targeting ads or to train or improve Gemini or any other generative AI models.

## How to use this prompt guide

This guide introduces you to prompting with Gemini for Workspace. It includes strong prompt design examples to help you get started. Additionally, it covers scenarios for different personas, use cases, and potential prompts.

You will notice a variety of prompt styles. Some prompts have brackets, which indicate where you would fill in specific details or tag your own personal files by typing @file name. Other prompts are presented without variables highlighted to show you what a full prompt could look like. All of the prompts in this guide are meant to inspire you, but ultimately they will need to be customized to help you with your specific work.

To get started, use the role-specific suggested prompts as inspiration to help you unlock a new and powerful way of working.

Use case: Develop a visual identity

You own your own consulting business and are often hired to function as a brand manager for your clients. You help businesses in a variety of industries. Your customer is getting ready to launch a coffee shop and video game cafe, and you need to kick-start the creative process by developing a visual identity. You want to ideate and provide early thoughts to the rest of the team. You decide to chat with Gemini Advanced. You type:

Generate ideas for a creative and eye-catching logo  for my new business, a coffee shop combined with a video game cafe. Generate a logo considering  the following:

Dual Concept: The logo needs to clearly signal both  the coffee and gaming aspects of the business without being too cluttered.

Target Audience: Appeal to a wide range of gamers (casual and enthusiast), as well as coffee lovers seeking a unique hangout spot.

Style Options: I'm open to these approaches - let's get a few examples in each of these three styles to compare: Modern and Playful: Bold colors, fun graphics, maybe a pixel art aesthetic. Retro-Cool: Think classic arcade style - chunky lettering, neon color inspiration. Sleek and Minimalist: Clean lines, geometric shapes, a more subtle nod to both themes.  (Gemini Advanced)

## Leveling up your prompt writing

This guide is meant to serve as inspiration, and the possibilities are nearly endless with Gemini for Google Workspace. Build on your prompt-writing skills using these tips.

-  Break it up. If you want Gemini for Workspace to perform several related tasks, break them into separate prompts.
-  Give constraints. To generate specific results, include details in your prompt such as character count limits or the number of options you'd like to generate.
-  Assign a role. To encourage creativity, assign a role. You can do this by starting your prompt with language like: 'You are the head of a creative department for a leading advertising agency …'
-  Ask for feedback. In your conversation with Gemini Advanced, tell it that you're giving it a project, include all the relevant details, and then describe the output you want. Continue the conversation by asking questions like, 'What questions do you have for me that would help you provide the best output?'
-  Consider tone. Tailor your prompts to suit your intended audience. Ask for outputs to have a specific tone, such as formal, informal, technical, creative, or casual.
-  Say it another way. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don't meet your expectations or if you believe there's room for improvement. An iterative process of review and refinement often yields better results.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it's still new. Even though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes have unpredictable responses.

Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review it to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans, but the final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.

## Selected Projects

## Graph-Powered Agentic RAG System - Advanced AI Research &amp; Development

Technologies: Python, LightRAG, LangGraph, Google Gemini API (Vision Pro &amp; Flash), PostgreSQL, Pydantic, MinerU

- Architected and built an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LightRAG) system to solve the 'fragmented context' problem inherent in traditional vector search-based RAG.
- Engineered a multi-stage, multi-modal ETL pipeline that intelligently processes complex PDFs, using a Vision Language Model (VLM) to analyze images and diagrams, and prepares the data for ingestion into a knowledge graph.
- Implemented a sophisticated multi-agent system using LangGraph , where specialized AI agents collaborate to analyze user queries, determine optimal hybrid retrieval strategies (vector + graph), and synthesize fragmented answers into coherent, actionable narratives.
- Demonstrated a significant leap in AI reasoning capabilities by enabling the system to understand and traverse the relationships between concepts, moving beyond simple keyword matching to structured, human-like understanding.

## LangGraph Agentic Auditing System - AI-Powered Financial Automation

Technologies: LangGraph, Python, LLMs, Pandas, Multi-Agent Systems

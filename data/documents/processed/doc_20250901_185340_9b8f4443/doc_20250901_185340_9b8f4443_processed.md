Second interaction maxes out the available context length and 'pushes' the first words out of the LLMs memory

## When using an AI system, how much it &lt;remembers= depends on the situation:

- Chatting with the AI : The AI needs to remember past messages so it can respond in a natural way and keep track of the conversation.
- Creating things like quizzes, flashcards, or questions : The AI doesn9t need to keep the history. Once it generates the content, we9re done and can move on without it remembering what came before.
- Adjusting the AI9s personality or style : This is somewhere in between. For example, if we want the AI to act like a tutor, we set its &lt;persona= to teacher mode and it stays that way for the whole session. If later we want it to act in a different style, like being more playful or curious, we just update the instructions and it switches modes.

This matters because how the AI remembers (or forgets) shapes how useful it is4whether it9s for having a conversation, generating content, or adapting to different situations.

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's a detailed description of the image, covering key information, text content, relationships, and technical details:

**Key Information & Insights:**

*   The image illustrates the workflow of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
*   It shows the flow of data and processing steps from a user's question to the final answer.
*   RAG enhances a language model by retrieving relevant context from a vector database, which helps in generating more informed and accurate responses.

**Readable Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "How RAG Works?"
*   **Boxes:**
    *   "QUESTION"
    *   "Vector Database"
    *   "RAG"
    *   "PROMPT" (containing "RAG Context" and "Question")
    *   "LLM" (indicating Large Language Model)
    *   "ANSWER" (with a label "Answer includes RAG context")

**Relationship to Document:**

*   **User Question:** The process begins with a user posing a question.
*   **Vector Database:** The question is used to query a vector database, likely to retrieve semantically similar documents or chunks of text.
*   **RAG:** The retrieved information becomes the RAG context.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** A prompt is constructed by combining the original question with the RAG context.
*   **LLM Processing:** The prompt is fed to a Large Language Model (LLM).
*   **Answer Generation:** The LLM generates an answer, leveraging both the user's question and the retrieved context. The answer should ideally incorporate information from the RAG context to provide a more complete and accurate response.

**Technical Details (Inferred):**

*   **Vector Database:** This implies using vector embeddings to represent the information in the database, enabling efficient similarity searches. Techniques like cosine similarity are probably used to find relevant documents.
*   **RAG:** It entails the retrieval stage is often implemented using algorithms to identify the most relevant chunks of information to be used by the language model.
*   **LLM:** Any LLM can theoretically be used for the task.

In summary, the image serves as a high-level visual explanation of the RAG architecture, a prominent technique for improving the performance of language models by integrating external knowledge.

Fine-tuning options are limited or not available at all (mostly prompt-based control).

## Setup Overhead

## Cloud Models:

No setup required 4 access instantly through an API.

## Flexibility

## Cloud Models:

Easier to scale and integrate; flexibility comes from APIs and built-in features.

## Maintenance

## Cloud Models:

Always updated by the provider; you automatically use the latest version.

## Open Source (e.g., LLaMA):

Can be fine-tuned extensively, adapted to niche tasks or languages.

## Cost Breakdown

Pricing per 1 million tokens (Input/Output).

## Why Output Costs More Than Input

When using AI language models, it usually costs more to get answers (output) than to give instructions or text (input). This isn9t random4it comes down to how the AI works.

- Input (what you type in): The AI can read and process all your text in one go. Think of it like scanning a page4it happens fast and efficiently.
- Output (what the AI writes back): The AI doesn9t write everything at once. Instead, it creates one word (or piece of a word) at a time. Each new word depends on the previous ones, so the AI has to &lt;think= repeatedly until the full answer is finished. That makes output more expensive.

## What a &lt;Turn= Means in a Conversation

A turn is one back-and-forth between you and the AI. It has two parts:

- Your input 3 this includes your message, plus any background information the system adds. 1.
- The AI9s output 3 the response it gives back. 2.

A conversation is just a series of these turns, where each new turn builds on the memory of the last ones, so the AI can stay on topic and make sense.

<!-- image -->

## How does input, output prices affect our choice?

When making an AI system , Each component or model receives different amounts of input , and geneartes different amounts of output , optimizing this is crucial for cost effectiveness.

## 1- RAG:

<!-- image -->

This diagram explains how RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works .

- You ask a question. 1.
- The system looks up relevant information in a special database (like a knowledge library). 2.
- That information is added to your question. 3.
- The AI then uses both your question and the extra information to give a more accurate and informed answer. 4.

So instead of the AI relying only on its memory, it first retrieves supporting facts and then generates a response.

## Analogy

Think of it like asking a friend for help with homework:

- You (the student) : Ask the question.
- The friend : Doesn9t just guess4they quickly check a textbook or notes (the database) for useful information.
- They combine your question with what they found and explain the answer to you.

This way, the response is both smarter and more trustworthy.

RAG System Cost AnalysisInBalanced vs Context-Heavy Workloads

<!-- image -->

- in a rag system since the context gets provided in the prompt it's an input heavy system.
- 80/20 sometimes.
- In this case it gives us more freedom and space to use a premium model.
- balancing the accuracy and cost effectiveness.

## 2- reacting to enviroment:

<!-- image -->

- Sometimes the AI uses information from its surroundings, like your preferences or details about the situation. This is a moderate level of usage 4it9s about half relying on stored knowledge and half on outside context.
- If the outside information is simple , a regular model is usually good enough. But if the information is complex or detailed , it9s worth using a more advanced (and more expensive) model to make sure the answers are accurate and reliable.

## 3- Generative:

- When the goal is to generate content like questions, quizzes, or flashcards , the balance is different. It9s mostly about producing output (80%) and only a little about understanding the input (20%).
- Because generating lots of output is the most expensive part of using AI , cost becomes a key factor to think about in this type of task.

## Correlation, cost and performance:

<!-- image -->

- This scatterplot shows how performance relates to cost.
- The Gemini models are performing better than the OpenAI models , while also being more affordable.
- The standout is Gemini 2.0 Flash 4its performance is close to Gemini 2.5 Flash but comes at a much lower cost, making it the best value overall.

<!-- image -->

## Cost Impact on Model Choice

## Input-Heavy Models (e.g., RAG)

## Balanced Models (e.g., Conversational AI)

Lower input token price is key.

Gemini 2.5 flash Would reason over context better.

Seek low combined input/output cost. Gemini 2.0 flash offers balance, it would be costeffective and have direct instructions.

## Generation-Heavy Models (e.g., Content Creation)

Output token price dominates.

Gemini 2.0 Flash is budgetfriendly for extensive text generation, with the right architecture i can make it way better.

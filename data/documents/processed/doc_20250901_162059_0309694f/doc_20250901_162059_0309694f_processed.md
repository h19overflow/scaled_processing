## Executive Summary

## Current Hardware Cannot Support Production Deployment

## Key Finding

## Bottom Line

L40S GPU is fundamentally inadequate for multi-user AI services due to critical performance limitations.

## Critical Metrics

- 80% failure rate at 32 concurrent users.
- Response time degradation from 3.5 seconds to 33+ seconds.
- 91.3% VRAM saturation before any user requests.

The L40S represents a technical deadend for production deployment of concurrent AI services. Immediate hardware upgrade is required.

## Research Methodology

## Formal Hypothesis Testing Approach

## Null Hypothesis (H )

## Alternative Hypothesis (H¡)

Increasing concurrent inference requests on L40S GPU has no significant negative effect on system failure rate, response latency, or semantic quality of Llama 3.1 8B model outputs.

Increasing concurrent requests will cause significant increases in failure rates and response latency, plus measurable degradation in response quality, coherence, and accuracy, resulting in hallucinations and unusable output.

Test Design: Systematic stress testing was conducted from 1 to 32 concurrent users, meticulously collecting comprehensive performance and quality metrics to validate our hypotheses. This approach allowed us to identify critical bottlenecks and assess system behavior under realistic load conditions.

In summary, the document image highlights the severe performance limitations of the L40S GPU in a multi-user AI service context. The data strongly suggests that the GPU is inadequate for the intended use case and that alternative hardware should be considered.



## Extreme Failure Rates Make Service Unusable

![Image 11](C:\Users\User\Projects\scaled_processing\data\documents\raw\extracted_images\L40S-GPU-Stress-Test-Results\picture-11.png)

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's a breakdown of the provided image and its context:

**Image Analysis:**

*   The image is a button or badge that reads "Made with GAMMA".
*   The button has a rounded rectangular shape with a dark blue background and a light blue border.
*   The text "Made with" is in a standard sans-serif font, while "GAMMA" is in a stylized font with geometric elements.

**Document Context & Summary:**

The document appears to be a technical report summarizing the results of a stress test performed on an L40S GPU, specifically for multi-user AI services.

*   **Executive Summary:** The core conclusion is that the L40S GPU is insufficient for production deployment due to performance limitations.
*   **Key Finding:** The report explicitly states the GPU is "fundamentally inadequate."
*   **Bottom Line:** Restates the key finding.
*   **Critical Metrics:** Provides quantitative data to support the conclusion. This includes:
    *   High failure rate (80%) at a relatively low concurrency level (32 users).
    *   Significant response time degradation, increasing almost tenfold.
    *   Near-total VRAM saturation even before user requests are processed, indicating a severe bottleneck.
*   **Visual Elements:** The document is stated to contain tables/charts that would likely provide further details and visualizations of the performance data.

**Relationship to Document:**

The "Made with GAMMA" button at the top indicates that the document itself, potentially the visual layout, data visualization, or presentation of results, was created using a software tool called "GAMMA".

**Technical Details:**

The document highlights several critical performance aspects related to the L40S GPU's ability to handle multi-user AI workloads. The specific issues revolve around:

*   **Concurrency:** The GPU struggles to handle a reasonable number of concurrent users.
*   **Response Time:** Performance degrades dramatically as load increases, making the system unusable.
*   **VRAM:** Insufficient VRAM to handle the demands of the AI models and user requests.

In summary, the report is a negative assessment of the L40S GPU for its intended purpose, backed up by specific performance metrics and likely further elaborated upon in the tables/charts.


Under load, the L40S GPU exhibits catastrophic reliability failures , rendering the service functionally useless for multi-user scenarios. This is not a partial degradation but a complete breakdown.

- 3 concurrent users: 75% failure rate
- 32 concurrent users: 80% failure rate
- 4 out of 5 user queries receive no response at peak load.

## Business Impact

- Cannot deploy a service that fails for the majority of users. This level of unreliability would immediately destroy user trust and render the application functionally useless.
- At high concurrency the llm was able to respond , but in flawed way , exposing internal prompt, changing language , repeating prompt or question.

## Response Times Become Unacceptable Under Load

![Image 12](C:\Users\User\Projects\scaled_processing\data\documents\raw\extracted_images\L40S-GPU-Stress-Test-Results\picture-12.png)

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's an analysis of the document image, based on the provided text and the single image provided.

**Key Information, Data, and Insights:**

*   **L40S GPU Inadequacy:** The core finding is that the L40S GPU is unsuitable for multi-user AI services. This is a critical point.
*   **Failure Rate:** A significant 80% failure rate was observed when supporting 32 concurrent users.
*   **Response Time Degradation:** The response time dramatically increases from 3.5 seconds to over 33 seconds under load.
*   **VRAM Saturation:** VRAM reaches 91.3% saturation before processing user requests.
*   **Stress Test Results** The document is reporting on the results of a stress test on the L40S GPU.

**Readable Text Content:**

*   "L40S GPU Stress Test Results"
*   "Technical Analysis and Hardware Recommendations"
*   "Executive Summary"
*   "Current Hardware Cannot Support Production Deployment"
*   "Key Finding"
*   "Bottom Line"
*   "L40S GPU is fundamentally inadequate for multi-user AI services due to critical performance limitations."
*   "Critical Metrics"
*   "80% failure rate at 32 concurrent users."
*   "Response time degradation from 3.5 seconds to 33+ seconds."
*   "91.3% VRAM saturation before any user req"
*   "[Document contains tables/charts]"

**Relationship to Document:**

*   The image showing a heart with an ECG line is likely an indicator for the health of the machine.

**Technical Details:**

*   The analysis focuses on GPU performance in a multi-user AI service context.
*   Metrics like failure rate, response time, and VRAM saturation are used to quantify performance.
*   The stress test involves 32 concurrent users.



- Single user: 3.5 seconds average response time
- 32 users: 33+ seconds average response time
- 10x performance degradation at scale, far beyond acceptable limits for interactive AI.

The performance degradation is exponential , not linear. Some users experience reasonable wait times, while others face delays of nearly a minute, leading to an inconsistent and frustrating experience.

## Business Impact

- Slow and unpredictable service leads to user frustration and abandonment. An AI assistant slower than manual work defeats the purpose of automation and provides no tangible value.
- When load is too much the model does not answer , in the case of 32 concurrent requests the model gave incoherent answers.

## Finding 3 - Quality Deterioration

## AI Output Becomes Unreliable and Incoherent

## Accuracy Volatility

## Context Loss

![Image 14](C:\Users\User\Projects\scaled_processing\data\documents\raw\extracted_images\L40S-GPU-Stress-Test-Results\picture-14.png)

**AI Analysis** (confidence: 0.9): Here's an analysis of the document image you provided:

**Key Information, Data, and Insights:**

*   The image displays "1.3M" in a large, bold font. This is likely a key metric or statistic related to the document's content, potentially representing a data point, a target, or a significant threshold.

**Readable Text Content:**

*   The most prominent readable text is "1.3M."

**Relationship to Document:**

*   Given the surrounding context of "L40S GPU Stress Test Results," "Executive Summary," and findings related to performance issues, the "1.3M" could represent:
    *   A memory capacity (e.g., 1.3 million bytes).
    *   A user count target that the GPU failed to support reliably.
    *   A performance target in terms of operations or transactions per unit time.

**Technical Details:**

*   The large, bold font suggests that this metric is intended to be easily seen and emphasizes its importance.
*   Without further context within the document, it's challenging to definitively determine what "1.3M" specifically refers to.



Accuracy scores become highly volatile under load, with unpredictable dips and spikes, making outputs unreliable.

The model frequently loses the ability to maintain conversational context, leading to disjointed and irrelevant responses.

## Response Incoherence

**Image analysis**

The number '512' is shown in the image.


A systematic breakdown in response coherence is observed, resulting in nonsensical or contradictory outputs.

Observable Failure Modes: The model "forgets" conversation context mid-response, generates contradictory or nonsensical outputs, and produces factually incorrect information (hallucinations). This is not just a performance issue; it's a fundamental quality collapse .

## Business Impact

- Unreliable AI output is worse than no AI 3 it actively misleads users and requires human verification, eliminating any potential efficiency gains and introducing new risks.

## Business Impact

- Actively misleading users. Worse than being simply wrong, this behavior is confusing and propagates incorrect information, completely undermining the AI's purpose as a reliable knowledge source.

## Complete System Breakdown in Response Generation

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

## question\_id: 7

- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning provides no explanation and is composed entirely of system-like text: "Answer: The question is in English, so the response will be in English. Here is the detailed response to the question: Answer: The final response which ends this conversation"
- question\_id: 14
- Evidence: Both the ai\_answer and ai\_reasoning are a nonsensical system message: "The final response which ends this conversation"
- question\_id: 16 (eval\_type: Answer)
- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning is not an explanation but a full copy of the original context provided in the prompt.

Technical Cause: Severe memory pressure on the L40S GPU forces the model to output fragments of internal programming or default messages, indicating that it cannot process or generate coherent responses.

    *   Failure rate
    *   Response time
    *   VRAM usage/saturation



## Business Impact

- Total system failure. The model is not even attempting to answer questions, indicating a complete and catastrophic breakdown in the generation process. This renders the AI completely ineffective.

## AI Exposes Internal Instructions to Users

## 32 Concurrent requests English:

This occurs when the AI "leaks" parts of its underlying instructions or system context into the user-facing response.

## question\_id: 13 (eval\_type: Answer)

- Evidence: The ai\_reasoning includes text that is clearly part of its instructions: "The writer mentions that he was deployed in an educational assessment system. Students rely on your accuracy and reasoning quality... LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: If the question and context are in Malay language, respond entirely in Malay..."

Technical Cause: Memory overflow causes the model to confuse internal instructions with response content, leading to a critical security and integrity breach.

## Business Impact

- Critical trust breach. Exposes system inner workings and produces nonsensical, untrustworthy text that fundamentally compromises user confidence and brand reputation.
- This is an unacceptable failure mode for any production system.
- This could lead to leaking sensitive information , or perhaps exposing company secrets in production.

## Root Cause Analysis

## VRAM Saturation

A critical analysis reveals that the L40S GPU experiences severe memory saturation, even before processing any user requests. This underlying issue directly contributes to the previously observed system instabilities and quality failures.

## Critical Memory Statistics

## Technical Implication

## Direct Consequence

- L40S total VRAM: 46,068 MiB
- Llama 3.1 8B model consumption: 42,055 MiB
- Memory utilization: 91.3% before any user connects
- Available working memory: Less than 9% (~3 GB)

## Summary of Findings

## Issue

The GPU9s memory is almost fully consumed by the AI model before any user interaction. The model alone occupies over 90% of available memory, leaving less than 10% free.

## Impact

Because conversations require additional memory to maintain context, the system is forced to aggressively clear and swap memory. This leads to frequent loss of conversation history.

## Consequence

The AI is unable to reliably maintain context, which directly results in contradictory, inconsistent, or nonsensical responses.

## Conclusion

The model is oversized for the available hardware, making stable and reliable operation impractical under current conditions.

Each concurrent user requires KV Cache memory for conversation context. With virtually no free VRAM, the system is forced into aggressive cache swapping and deletion.

When the model loses its KV Cache, it loses conversation context. This is the direct technical cause of all observed hallucinations, contradictory logic, and nonsensical outputs.

## Real-World vs Test Environment

## Actual Production Load Would Be Worse

The stress test results, while alarming, were conducted under controlled conditions that do not fully replicate the complexities of a real-world production environment. Understanding these differences is crucial for assessing the true potential for system failure.

## Test Environment Characteristics:

## Real-World Environment:

- Structured, sequential testing (e.g., 1 user ³ stop ³ 5 users ³ stop)
- Predictable "burst-and-rest" patterns, allowing for memory recovery
- Continuous, unpredictable request streams
- Multiple users with overlapping sessions
- No graceful rest periods for memory recovery or cache clearing
- Controlled timing between requests

Implication: The 80% failure rate observed in our controlled stress tests represents a best-case scenario . A live production environment would likely experience significantly higher failure rates and more severe quality degradation due to constant memory pressure and lack of recovery periods.

## Underestimated Risk

The controlled test environment provided a generous operational window for the GPU to recover. In a genuine production scenario, the L40S GPU would face relentless, concurrent demands , exacerbating memory saturation and leading to even more frequent and severe quality failures for end-users.

## GPU Performance Analysis

## Hardware Performing Optimally Within Design Limits

A detailed analysis of the L40S GPU during stress testing confirms that the hardware itself is operating within its design limits and performing optimally, ruling out common causes of failure such as overheating or insufficient processing power.

## GPU Health Indicators

- Performance State: Consistent P0 (maximum level)
- Temperature: Never exceeded 68°C (well within limits)
- Power Draw: ~280W (below 350W limit)
- No Thermal Throttling or Hardware Malfunctions

## Critical Insight

System failures are NOT caused by:

- GPU overheating
- Insufficient processing power
- Hardware defects
- Software inefficiencies

## Conclusion

The GPU is running at its full potential, yet this potential is fundamentally insufficient for our requirements. The hardware is performing as designed, but its design limits are being exceeded by the demands of the AI model.

## Technical Solution Requirements

## Current Constraint

## Hardware Needs for Production Deployment

The fundamental limitation identified is that the L40S GPU's VRAM capacity is insufficient to load the AI model and simultaneously support the necessary KV (Key-Value) cache for multiple concurrent user sessions, leading to memory saturation and system instability.

## Sufficient VRAM Capacity

The new hardware must provide ample VRAM to comfortably accommodate the Llama 3.1 8B model and maintain KV caches for a robust number of concurrent user sessions without aggressive swapping or memory loss.

## Enterprise-Grade Reliability &amp; Performance

## Scalability for Concurrent Users

This includes head-room for future model updates or additional features.

The solution requires hardware designed for continuous, high-load operation, ensuring stability, consistent performance, and minimal downtime to meet enterprise service level agreements (SLAs).

This includes robust error handling and fault tolerance.

The chosen hardware must be inherently scalable, capable of efficiently supporting hundreds of concurrent users, dynamically adjusting to demand spikes, and ensuring a seamless, responsive experience for every user.

This implies not just more VRAM, but also optimized memory management.
